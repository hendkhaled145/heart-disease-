# heart-disease-
test if the person has heart disease or not

Data description :
The data set consists of some personal information which is:
age : is the age of person 
Gender : if the person is male or female 
Chest pain type : the number of person who have pain in the chest and how is this pain
Resting blood pressure : the maximum amount of heart beat and minimum one 
Serum cholesterol : this show blood cholesterol level 
Fasting blood sugar : measure blood sugar while haven't eaten anything before
Maximum heart rate : the maximum heart beat that heart can beat
Exercise induced angina : if the person have a very hard pain in his chest when he do exercises 
Oldpeak : if he had angina before 
Number of major : is how many blood vessels carry blood through the body
Problem definition : 
This information will be analysed and test if the person has heart disease or not based on the number of heart disease cases and rates of patient who have same features 


Data preprocessing: 
we used the normalization in neural network to scale the date set into (0,1) so the program can easily deal with , And in the tree algorithm it automatically do a discretization as a preprocessing

Data mining algorithms we used : 
1- tree : to build classification and regression models
2- naive bayes :because it is easy and fast to predict the class of the test data set
3- neural network :because it can learn and model non-linear and complex relationships, and have the capacity to manage the reality between the relationship of inputs and outputs
